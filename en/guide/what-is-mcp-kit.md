# What is MCP Kit?

MCP Kit is a toolkit for creating MCP (Model Context Protocol) applications with ease, enabling developers to build MCP-compliant servers and client applications.

## What MCP Kit Provides

MCP Kit offers a complete set of tools and frameworks to help developers quickly set up MCP applications:

* **Quick project scaffolding**: Create project structures through simple CLI commands
* **TypeScript support**: Out-of-the-box TypeScript configuration
* **Built-in development tools**: Including testing, building, and code quality tools
* **Configurable project templates**: Adaptable to different development needs
* **Multiple transport modes**: Support for stdio, streamable-http, and SSE communication methods
* **Comprehensive APIs**: Rich interfaces supporting various functionality implementations

## Core Features of MCP Kit

MCP Kit supports creating two types of projects:

### MCP Server

Create an MCP server that provides tools, resources, and prompts for MCP clients. Servers can:

* Implement custom tools for client use
* Define resources accessible by clients
* Create reusable prompt templates
* Support multiple transport modes (stdio, HTTP, SSE)

### MCP Client

Create client applications that connect to MCP servers and use their tools, resources, and prompts. Clients can:

* Connect to servers using various transport modes
* Call tools provided by servers
* Access resources defined by servers
* Use prompt templates created by servers

## Why Choose MCP Kit?

MCP Kit allows developers to focus on business logic rather than underlying implementation details. Through standardized interfaces and tools, it simplifies the development process for MCP applications, making it easier and more efficient to create high-quality AI applications.

Whether you want to create an MCP server providing specific functionality or need a client application that leverages these capabilities, MCP Kit provides the tools and frameworks needed to quickly achieve your goals.
