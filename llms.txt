MCP Kit is a toolkit for creating MCP (Model Context Protocol) applications with ease, enabling developers to build MCP-compliant servers and client applications. It consists of two major parts:

- A scaffolding system that quickly generates MCP server and client projects with [pre-configured TypeScript setup](https://my-mcp-hub.github.io/mcp-kit/guide/what-is-mcp-kit.html) and built-in developer tools for rapid development.

- Project templates that provide standardized structure for both [MCP servers and clients](https://my-mcp-hub.github.io/mcp-kit/guide/what-is-mcp.html), pre-configured to follow Model Context Protocol specifications.

In addition, MCP Kit streamlines the development workflow with [getting started guides](https://my-mcp-hub.github.io/mcp-kit/guide/getting-started.html) and best practices with full TypeScript support.
